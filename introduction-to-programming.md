# Introduction to programming

### What is programming

Although it might seem a complicated type of activity, in essence it’s just representing your ideas in some programming language’s code.

### What is programming language

It all goes down to computers being able to "understand" your idea. That requires the way of describing the idea, which is different from a regular human language. The main issue with human-languages is that they are not formal and can afford a lot of ambiguity. But computers in general are very unfamiliar with these ambiguities, so they require special ways of idea description.

That's why we can not use English or any other human-language to create a program for computers. And we need a special, more formal language to describe our ideas to computers.

Several examples of programming languages: C++, Java, Python, PHP, Haskell. There are quite many programming languages.

These “ways” are usually being called algorithms.
