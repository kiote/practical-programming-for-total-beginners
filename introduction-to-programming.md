# Introduction to programming

### What is programming

Although it might seem a complicated type of activity, in essence it’s just representing your ideas in some programming language’s code.

### What is programming language

It all goes down to computers being able to "understand" your idea. That requires the way of describing the idea, which is different from a regular human language. The main issue with human-languages is that they are not formal and can afford a lot of ambiguity. But computers in general are very unfamiliar with these ambiguities, so they require special ways of idea description.

That's why we can not use English or any other human-language to create a program for computers. And we need a special, more formal language to describe our ideas to computers.

Several examples of programming languages: C++, Java, Python, PHP, Haskell. There are quite many programming languages.

### What programming language is in this course?

The main programming language used in this course is Python. It was chosen mainly because it is very popular, so you’ll be able to find help very easy, there are many resources for Python beginners available. Another reason it’s relatively easy to start with your first working program in Python, usually it’s already pre-installed in your operating system.

These “ways” are usually being called algorithms.
