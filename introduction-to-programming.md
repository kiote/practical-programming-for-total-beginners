# Introduction to programming

### What is programming

Although it might seem a complicated type of activity, in essence it’s just representing your ideas in some programming language’s code.

Since it all goes down to computers being able to "understand" your idea. That requires the way of describing the idea, which is different from a regular human language. The main issue with human-languages is that they are not formal and can afford a lot of ambiguity. But computers in general are very unfamiliar with these ambiguities, so they require special ways of idea description.

These “ways” are usually being called algorithms.
