# Introduction to course

There are tons of resources online which promise to teach you how to program. Why do we need yet another one?

This course has several differences:

* It doesn’t promise to make you a programmer, not even a junior one. You can use it as a start though, but it’s a big journey;
* It has as much theory as you need to grasp main ideas, it doesn’t use any term before explaining it. So for some it might seem to be boring and slow;
* It concentrated mostly on practical exercise. You can not do programming without practicing it. Course offers a lot of practice which you should not skip;
* It requires a lot of self-educating, looking for answers online and checking up with documentation.

### Is this course for me?

This course is made for you if:

* You have no or very limited prior experience in programming;
* You would like to automate some of your daily tasks, but have not enough knowledge about what is possible to automate and how to do it;
* You would like to understand what are you actually doing, not just copy-paste code and hope it works.

### What's in this course?

It has two big parts: theory and practical exercises. 

Theory is going to be presented in a less formal way than regular courses probably do, but it's always better to explain complex stuff in an easy way, than to explain easy stuff in a complex way, right?

The main programming language used in this course is Python. It was chosen mainly because it is very popular, so you’ll be able to find help very easy, there are tons of resources for Python beginners. Another reason it’s relatively easy to start with your first working program in Python, usually it’s already pre-installed in your operating system.

### What I’ll be able to do after finishing this course?

There are several practical tasks in this course, which can be used as ready projects, for example: checking some websites automatically for updates, renaming files in bulk, updating Excel spreadsheets and more, the only limit is your fantasy!
