# What do you need to start

To be able to follow this course you should have a MacOS or Windows computer. There is exactly one set of recommended software to start I present here. That doesn't mean you can not use anything else. But if you are a total beginner, it’s easier to have one option than a million.

### Programming language

To write any program you will need a programming language installed to your system. 

If to be more correct with terms, you are not installing a programming language itself, but a program which will interpret any text file as instructions on a given programming language.

With this being said, we are going to install the Python 3.8 interpreter. 

### Code editor

Although programs are just text files, you will need a special editor to write and edit these files. This is just for your own comfort, since this editor will help you to see the language constructions easily and it will highlight errors you made, so you can fix those with less effort.

We are going to install whatever the latest version of Atom editor.

### Terminal

Whether you are on Windows or MacOS you already have a program called terminal there. You will need this terminal to run your first programs. Also it will be needed during the installation steps. Terminal is also known as "command line", so if in some documents you can see the command line, it means more or less the same as terminal.

Terminal's main purpose is to allow you to type _commands_ in plain text into your operating system and see some replies to these commands.

**To open terminal on MacOS**: open your Applications folder, then open Utilities and double-click on Terminal. 

**To open terminal on Windows**: Open start menu, type “cmd” \(without quotes\) and hit Enter.

### Python installation for Windows 

### Python installation for MacOS

There is a big chance that you already have Python installed in your system. But there is also a big chance that you have a previous version of Python. It is very important to install the same version we use in this tutorial. Otherwise some \(or even all\) code from examples will not work for you.

To check the version you have, switch to Terminal window you've opened on previous step. Type

```text
python --version
```

and hit Enter. You should see some reply from this command. If this reply is not 3.8, but something else, you should install Python anyway \(newer version\).
